# 📱 Mobile Pool

> Mobile development bootcamp with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive series of mobile development learning modules built with React Native. Each module progressively covers essential concepts and features for modern mobile application development, from basic components to advanced authentication and data management.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized development)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each module is self-contained and can be run independently.

### Web Development

```bash
cd mobileModuleXX
pnpm install
pnpm web
```

### Docker

```bash
cd mobileModuleXX
docker compose up
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8081`

> ⚠️ **Note for Windows users**: Docker performance on Windows is extremely slow due to file system synchronization between Windows and the Linux container. For better performance, consider using the web development method instead.
